# About This Project

This is a demo project of MES(Manufacturing Execution System) using state machine to control the manufacturing process.

Normally there are a dozen of stations on the manufacturing line, a production shall pass the previous station to continue on the next one. This is a typical scenario for state machine.

In this version, a StartupRunner is used to send Events.

Future version will use front end HTML to send events and create state machine for each barcode.
